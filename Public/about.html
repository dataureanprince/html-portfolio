    <h1>About Sean</h1>
    
    <p>I would like to officially invite you to my world, i took up web development again on June 21st 2025 after several tries</p>
    
    <p>I am dedicating this next half of the year to build this skill, hopefully to sharpen my thoughts and coding skills and also prove to myself that i have what it takes to transform my life with the help of God</p>
    
    <p>I believe with God on my side i will not fail, may this journey help me enter doors i've been standing behind for years scared to enter. </p>
    
    <p>Grow with me and as always, Love and Light to you.</p>
    
    <p>Stay Jiggy</p>
